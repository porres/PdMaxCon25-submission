As a composer and musician, I have a varied background in diverse activities. I have done soundtracks for short films, animation and live plays. I've written instrumental, electronic, mixed pieces and I’ve also worked with experimental and even pop music. As a performer, most of my work is in live electronics.

In the last years I've been heavily active in the local scene of São Paulo, especially in the events at the Ibrasotope artist-run center. There's a big scene of experimental and improvised music and I've participated as a solo and in various group formations, mostly doing Live Electronics and free improvisation. There's also a noise scene that I've actively participated in many performances as a soloist and with collaborators.

## Solo Performances as Patch Shop Boy

**"Patch Shop Boy"** – I have used this name as a project/show name of my live performances. This is the submitted proposal for the PdMaxConference 2025. 
 
On this github page I have the latest live recording of a gig I did in may 2015 (see flyer below). You can download the .flac file for listening, but the same track is also uploaded to [https://soundcloud.com/porres/patch-shop-boy-live-performance-may-31st-2025](https://soundcloud.com/porres/patch-shop-boy-live-performance-may-31st-2025)
